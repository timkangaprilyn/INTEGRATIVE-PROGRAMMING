1. Difference between readyState and status:
   - The readyState is the one who shows or tracks the progress of request (example 4,it means that the request is complete).
   - After the readyState the next that will check is the status. It is the HTTP response code or the result of response (example 200, it means the request is successful).

2. Making the request asynchronous:
   - By setting the third parameter of xhr.open() to true, e.g., xhr.open("GET", url, true) it means asynchronus otherwise ift it's false it will be sychronus.

3. Why asynchronous communication is recommended:
   - It is recommended to avoid or prevents the webpage from freezing while waiting for a response.
   - It also allows the users to keep interacting with the page while data loads in the background.
